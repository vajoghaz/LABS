If I think back how ridiculous the fact that I was hired to be able to complete setting up the PIM project, than they did not even let close to it.

I completely forgot about this. This was OneIdentity where I thought I was going to do a good job while I was only required to perform firefighting. Nothing more. Why did they ask me about PIM as apart of a technical interview telling me that it something needed to be set-up? I do not know. They have never let me even close to the PIM set-up, so this lab in my own paid environment will make total sense. 

This technical interview was a "THIRD" unexpected one. Like the THIRD unexpected one with Koerber where I was answering an AZ-700 problem and then I have never been let close to the problem they seemed to have hired me to solve. This was the third "THIRD" interview I had with Citibank. There seem to be a job to do here as well from Blueprints to SaaS, ExpressRoute, Entra Connect, Entra Sync and Intune. There is a chanve that this is a pattern repeats itself.

So, PIM. Will have the trial and document all the steps!
