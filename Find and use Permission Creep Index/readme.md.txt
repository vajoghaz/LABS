Your company has recently adopted Microsoft Entra Permissions Management to enhance its Zero Trust security model across multiple Microsoft cloud platforms.

You need to ensure that permissions are right-sized and continuously monitored to prevent over-privileged identities.

Which strategy should you implement?

Using the Permission Creep Index is the most effective strategy to evaluate and adjust permissions regularly. This approach provides a systematic way to identify and mitigate risks associated with excessive permissions. Periodic permission reviews, while useful, are not as efficient or effective in maintaining real-time security. Conditional access policies and role-based access control are important security measures but do not directly address the challenge of managing permissions.
