You can deploy an SQL managed instance to a dedicated virtual network subnet that does not have any resource connected. The subnet can have a service endpoint or can be delegated for a different service. For this scenario, you can deploy managed1 to Subnet2, Subnet3, and Subnet4 only. You cannot deploy managed1 to Subnet1 because Subnet1 has a connected virtual machine.
