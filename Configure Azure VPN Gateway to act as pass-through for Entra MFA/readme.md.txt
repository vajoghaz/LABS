With Microsoft Entra authentication a Conditional Access policy can be configured to grant access and require MFA for authentication through VPN. During authentication, Azure VPN Gateway acts as a pass-through and forwards authentication messages back and forth between the authentication server and the connecting device. 

Note: Azure certificate-based authentication does not include interactive authentication.
