Agentless scanning for AWS (Preview)

Enabling agentless scanning in Microsoft Defender for Servers provides the required continuous vulnerability assessment and threat detection without deploying additional agents, aligning with the organization's multi-cloud strategy. Using Microsoft Defender for Cloud's built-in tool would require additional agents, which is not desired. Using Microsoft Defender for Cloud's agent-based threat detection is limited to Azure and requires agents, failing to meet the multi-cloud requirement

it works with a CloudFormation Stack pre-written.
